# Amatrix ERP

This project is my first one. I learn't to code C# through it. It contains many features, Although so I have discontinued the project on the pretence of bad code and coding practices within the project. The system is a huge resource hog and needs Crossthreading to just make it not lag.

In order to use you must install:

MSSQLCE3.5
Microsoft POS which is included in the Main/Main/bin/Debug/setup folder.
